# Unemployment Analysis in India 🇮🇳

## Project Overview

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on India's unemployment dataset to identify trends, patterns, and regional differences in unemployment rates over time.

The goal is to extract meaningful insights using data visualization and statistical techniques.

## Objective 

Analyze unemployment trends across different regions

Understand variation in employment rate over time

Identify patterns using visualization techniques

Perform correlation analysis between features

## Dataset Features

The dataset contains the following columns:

Region – Name of the state/region

Date – Time period of observation

Estimated Unemployment Rate (%)

Estimated Employed

Estimated Labour Participation Rate (%)

## Dataset
Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gokulrajkmv/unemployment-in-india

## Tools & Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook

## Project Workflow

1. Data Loading

Imported dataset using Pandas

Checked dataset structure and datatypes

2️. Data Cleaning

Checked for missing values

Handled null values (if any)

Converted date column into datetime format

3️. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Distribution of unemployment rate

Region-wise unemployment comparison

Time-series trend analysis

Labour participation analysis

4️. Data Visualization

Line plots for trend analysis

Bar charts for regional comparison

Correlation heatmap to understand feature relationships

## Analysis Performed
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- State-wise unemployment analysis
- Time series analysis
- COVID-19 impact on unemployment
- Urban vs Rural comparison

## Key Insights

Unemployment rate varies significantly across regions.

Certain periods show spikes indicating economic fluctuations.

Labour participation rate has moderate correlation with employment levels.

Some regions consistently show higher unemployment rates.
